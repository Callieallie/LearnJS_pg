    -------- Learn HTML/CSS Notes --------
    --- HTML Elements (they become tags when wrapped in <>)
    h1: The most important topic of the page (Big Newspaper Title) ONE PER PAGE
    h2: Defines titles of the page's major sections (sub-sections of h1)
    h3-h6: Each heading-type represents a further subsection of it's predecessor
    ***Think of headers like you would the alphanumeric outline system in paper drafting
    ***Roman Numerals, Capitalized Letters, Arabic Numerals (1-9), and Lowercase Letters
