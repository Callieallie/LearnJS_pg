                        <p>It is important to use paragraphs as you would in an English class. Each paragraph should have its own topic. A paragraph element should not hold several paragraphs of content. Instead, stick to using a seperate paragraph element for each paragraph of content.</p>
                        <p>A paragraph can be as short as a single sentence or prompt or as long as you want so long as you stick to the one topic.</p>
                        <p>Although you may be tempted to add newline breaks with the br element, it is not reccomended that you do so unless you are working with an address or a poem.</p>

                    <h2>Lists: Ordered (ol) and Unordered (ul)</h2>
                    <div class="centerDividerContents">
                        <p>Ordered and unordered lists are commonly reffered to as bullet or numbered lists in document editing software such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.</p>
                        <p>An ordered list will indicate some sort of precidence in the list of each list item. Think of the classic college paper outline. In an outline, it matters which topic is first, second, third, etc.</p>
                        <p>An unordered list is comparable to the standard bullet list. In an unordered list, it does not matter which list element is listed first, second, or third.</p>
                        <p>The following displays the general format of a list.</p>
                        <code>
                            &lt;<span class="elementCodeExample">ul</span>&gt;<br>
                            <!--
                                Initially, I displayed the code as a list using "&lt" to escape the "<" 
                                character and "&gt" to escape the ">" character.
                            -->
                            <!--
                                Scott reccomended that I use a code HTML elment to wrap my list example 
                                as that better describes the information I want to convey. 
                                I removed the ul and li elements and created indentation using "&emsp" which inserts a space.
                            -->

                        </code>
                        <p>Lists can also be nested inside of one another. When nesting lists, be careful to include the nested list in the list item element it is a part of.</p>

    -------- Learn HTML/CSS Notes --------
    --- HTML Elements (they become tags when wrapped in <>)
    BLOCK ELEMENTS
    h1: The most important topic of the page (Big Newspaper Title) ONE PER PAGE
    h2: Defines titles of the page's major sections (sub-sections of h1)
    h3-h6: Each heading-type represents a further subsection of it's predecessor
    ***Think of headers like you would the alphanumeric outline system in paper drafting
    ***Roman Numerals, Capitalized Letters, Arabic Numerals (1-9), and Lowercase Letters
    br: used to add a newline/carriage-return. NOT FOR SEPERATING PARAGRAPHS (or elements)!
            - The br element should be reserved for poems and addresses.
            - DO NOT use the br element to format a paragraph
    LANDMARK ELEMENTS
    main: Represents the dominant content of the page
    header: Contains any repeated Intro to the Page content (often the h1)
    footer: Contains miscelanious information towards the end of a page
    ----
    INLINE ELEMENTS
    strong: used to strongly emphasize important sections of text in a paragraph. Is inline in nature.
            - DO NOT use a strong element as a way to bolden text.
            - HTML should be used for meaning. If you need bold text, use CSS.
            - Use strong to point out words or phrases that encompass the meaning of a paragraph or page.
    b: "bring attention to". Draws attention but does not add emphasis.
            - Use b to add some contrast in focus.
            - Imagine the text in the b element saying "notice me :)"
    em: "emphasis". Does not have to do with importance, but rather inflection.
            - "Did *you* find the keys?" emphasizes "you"
            - Again, DO NOT use em or any other HTML element for style.
    i: "idiomatic text". Word(s) spoken in a differing voice or mood.
            - Often used for parts of text in a different language.
            - Can be used for the voice of a character in a story, or to show sarcasm.
            - The lang attribute should be put on any i element representing a language change.

    - Meaningful headings are important especially for screen readers and for SEO
    - Axe is the name of a popular accessability testing tool
    - Boilerplate: "!"+tab will create a basic HTML template
